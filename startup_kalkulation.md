# VPN Startup Calculation for a Solo Founder

This document provides an **example calculation** for setting up a VPN service as a sole proprietorship (“solo founder”). It serves as a guide to **server costs**, **break-even points**, and **growth forecasts** when starting with **the lowest possible fixed costs**.

---

## 1. Initial Situation

- **Goal**: Launch your own VPN service, operated by a single person (development, administration, support, marketing).  
- **Starting Point**: 0 users.  
- **Sample Pricing Models**:  
  - **Basic**: €5.99/month  
  - **Pro**: €11.99/month  
  - **Ultimate**: €23.99/month  

Assuming a distribution of (e.g.) 30% Basic, 50% Pro, 20% Ultimate, the **average monthly revenue per user (ARPU)** is approximately **€12**.

---

## 2. Minimal Infrastructure Costs (Dedicated Server)

### Initial Phase (0–200 Users)

- **1–2 dedicated servers** are sufficient to run a VPN prototype, including test users.  
- One **server** with a 1 Gbit/s connection and unmetered traffic costs around €150/month.  
- **Two servers** (redundant, for fail-safety) = 2 × €150 = €300/month.

### Scaling with User Growth

- **2 servers**: sufficient for about ~200–300 users.  
- **4–6 servers** (€600–900/month): for ~1,000 users.  
- **8–10 servers** (€1,200–1,500/month): for ~3,000–5,000 users.  
- **12 servers** (~€1,800/month): for ~10,000 users.  

This way, **server costs** scale gradually with user growth.

---

## 3. Minimal Ongoing Expenses

1. **Domain & SSL**  
   - Domain: ~€1–10/month.  
   - SSL (e.g., Let’s Encrypt): free.

2. **Payment Fees**  
   - PayPal, Stripe, credit cards: typically **2–3%** of revenue + possible fixed transaction fees.

3. **Marketing**  
   - With no budget: purely organic growth (SEO, forums, social media).  
   - **Recommendation**: at least a small budget (e.g., €200/month) for ads or sponsored posts to acquire the first customers.

4. **Other**  
   - Email service: €0–50/month.  
   - Accounting/tax consultant: varies, potentially a few hundred euros per year.

---

## 4. Example Calculation: Monthly Costs in the Early Phase

- **2 Dedicated Servers**: €300/month  
- **Small Marketing Budget**: €200/month  
- **Other** (domain, email, bookkeeping): €50/month  

**Total**: ~€550/month  

*(Payment fees only apply if you actually generate revenue.)*

---

## 5. Break-Even and Growth (Scenario)

### Break-Even at ~50 Users

- ARPU = €12/month  
- Fixed costs = €550/month  
- **Users to break even**: 550/12 ≈ 46 (round to 50).

**Explanation**:  
- As soon as you have **about 50 paying users**, revenue (€600) covers the fixed costs (€550).  
- Every additional user increases profit from that point on.

### Conservative Growth Assumption (10 new users/month)

- **Month 1**: 10 users → revenue: €120 → costs: €550 → result: –€430  
- **Month 2**: 20 users → revenue: €240 → costs: €550 → result: –€310  
- **Month 3**: 30 users → revenue: €360 → costs: €550 → result: –€190  
- **Month 4**: 40 users → revenue: €480 → costs: €550 → result: –€70  
- **Month 5**: 50 users → revenue: €600 → costs: €550 → result: +€50 (break-even)  
- **Month 6**: 60 users → revenue: €720 → costs: €550 → result: +€170  

Within 6 months, you’re in the black (despite a very small advertising spend). The **losses** of the first four months total only a few hundred euros.

### Accelerated Growth (100 new users/month)

- **Month 1**: 100 users → revenue €1,200 → costs €550 → profit ~€650  
- **Month 2**: 200 users → revenue €2,400 → costs €550 → profit ~€1,850  
- **Month 3**: 300 users → revenue €3,600 → costs €550 → profit ~€3,050  

Within just a few months, you’d have a significant surplus. Realistically, at this stage you might **invest more** in marketing or **scale servers** once user numbers rise.

---

## 6. Long Term: 10,000 Users

- With **10,000 paying users** and €12 ARPU:  
  - **Revenue**: ~€120,000/month  
  - **Server costs** (12 servers): €1,800/month  
  - **Other**: a few thousand euros (marketing, support tools, etc.)  

Even then, fixed costs remain relatively low. The profit margin would be very high, **provided** you continue alone and manage (support, maintenance) the workload yourself. In practice, you’d likely hire **employees** at some point to handle support and administration.

---

## 7. Conclusion

1. **Low Entry Barrier**  
   - As a solo founder, you can start with **minimal monthly fixed costs** (e.g., ~€550).  
   - **Break-even** is reached at around **50 paying users**.

2. **Scalability**  
   - Server costs grow gradually (adding more dedicated servers as needed).  
   - With more users, **revenue** increases much faster than server expenses.

3. **Profitability**  
   - Even with **moderate growth**, you can turn a profit within a few months.  
   - **High margins** possible, provided you do everything yourself and don’t spend heavily on marketing.

4. **Real Challenge**  
   - **Time, expertise, and effort**: You’re the developer, admin, support, and marketing all in one.  
   - **Market penetration**: VPN is a competitive market. A purely organic strategy takes patience; paid advertising can be costly.

Nonetheless, this example shows that launching a VPN project is **absolutely feasible** without incurring massive initial costs—assuming you have the **technical knowledge**, **time**, and **energy** to do everything yourself.
